	<h2>Health: Afflictions</h2><p>On March 3nd, 2020, Miranda issued a press release that she had contracted anemia. True to her form, Miranda managed to turn the news into a political issue, attacking the "liberal vegan elite" for "canceling" meat. In response, Democratic Party Vice President of Vegan Affairs Rhonda LaGoo blamed Miranda for being stupid, calling her a "silly imitation-goose-meat."<br><br>Miranda is also an avid sufferer of atopic dermatitis eczema on her hands, which causes flaky skin resembling asbestos or a snow globe. Miranda has joked that she has "handruff" and must use "Hand and Shoulders" "hand-poo" (referencing Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo).<br><br>Miranda's doctors, in a strange violation of HIPAA protocol, announced on her behalf that she was the first female case of a his-nia, an affliction similar to a hernia but only for men. Miranda developed her his-nia while moving patio furniture onto her roof. Many[who?] have suggested this is related to her asstrological aspirations, and that Miranda was trying to get as high up as she could to try to touch the moon. </p><br><br><h2>Health: Controversies</h2><p>Miranda has been criticized many times in the news for her treatment of debilitating conditions. On August 13, 2019, in the midst of The Feud, Miranda tweeted from her personal Twitter @69miranda69 that <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a> "was all upset because he has his rectal veins in a knot. Did someone say roid rage?" Hemorrhoid activists and the general media criticized the term roid rage and even made calls to boycott Miranda's one-woman show on tour with the USO in Kuwait. As a defense, Miranda revealed that she too suffered from a hemorrhoid, brought on by attempting to pass a walnut that she had unknowingly ingested. Shortly after, Miranda began selling "Yes I Have Roid Rage" shirts and buttons in her online shop, Miranda Sells. </p>
