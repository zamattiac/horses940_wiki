	Glenadine is a recurring actor in the Horses940 universe. Dropped on her head many times as a child, Glenadine provides a unique point of view to Horses940's videos. <br><br>Glenadine's interest in acting as a career began in 1945, after she accidentally attended the signing of the formal surrender documents that ended World War 2 aboard the U.S.S Missouri. Mistaking the ship for the Titanic, Glenadine boarded and was photographed in the background of the historic event. Glenadine, inspired by the boat she thought had inspired the movie Titanic, applied for the Julliard School of Arts, and was promptly accepted. This whirlwind of events led to her being cast in the lauded Horses940 production, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4us9qLVqgkI">Storage Wars</a>, based on The Storage Wars, an eruption of violence shortly after World War 2. Most people outside the storage locker community are not aware of this international conflict.<br><br>Glenadine also purports to have discovered the planet Jupiter. Although these claims have been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS809US809&sxsrf=ALeKk03WGYkO6oNPf1REfsD4B-mt0ypIUg%3A1596470897293&ei=cTYoX4DDEaiFytMPtriImAQ&q=who+discovered+jupiter&oq=who+discovered+jupiter&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgcIABAUEIcCOgQIIxAnOgUIABCRAjoFCC4QkQJQwSxYvEZggUdoAnAAeACAAX6IAe8NkgEEMjAuMpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjAv-jFtf_qAhWognIEHTYcAkMQ4dUDCAw&uact=5">disputed by the media</a>, it is still not clear if Glenadine is telling the truth, or what she is capable of when it comes to the science of the stars and the wide expanse of space that settles over Earth.<br><br>Glenadine's family members have been cited as working behind the scenes at Horses940 Incorporated. Most notable is her Auntie Hisstamean, who regulates the temperature of all Horses940 sets so as to suppress unwanted paranormal and paralegal activity.
