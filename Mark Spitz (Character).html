	<h1>Mark Spitz (Character)</h2>
	<p>
	Mark Spitz is well known for his brief romantic entanglement with <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a> of Horses940, but their relationship started out professional. A profoundly gifted actor, Spitz was cast to portray <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a>'s house in zoey101 Season 5 Premiere. Starting from the ground floor, Spitz was an essential part of the launch of Horses940 productions, although he now is an uber driver in Springfield, Virginia, choosing to stay out of the spotlight.<br><br>	Matt and Mark's romance is one that fans have not forgotten about - and the two are often linked in the media, although Matt has sworn off dating ghosts for now - as it has only ever brought him trouble in the past.
