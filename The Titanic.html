	<h1>The Titanic</h2>
	
	<p>
	<i>"This is a very large boat"</i><br><br>	The Titanic is a fake ship invented by <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a> and <a href=Miranda.html>Miranda</a> for their eponymous smash video. The idea of the Titanic is borrowed by fellow content creator, James Cameron for his eponymous flop video.<br><br>	Often confused by amateurs for a similar video by the name of <i>Remember the Titans</i>, a movie about football players, Titanic can be identified by it being about love and romance and drag. That is the plot for the most part.<br><br>	No one really knows what happened to The Titanic after filming; some say it was dismantled and put in <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a>'s backyard for storage, others swear they saw it sink in the North Atlantic in the early morning of April 15, 1912, and still other cast members and crew say the boat never existed in the first place. There is a division among this group; some claim the viewer was misled (an optional illusion so to speak) and others claim a small dinghy was used as the set and eaten by termites and beavers.<br><br>	Viewer viewership was so well-received (80 views as of August 8, 2020 at 12:05 AM) that the cast reunited for a sequel to this location: <i>The Titanic 2: Here We Go Again!</i> where luckily no one was injured because they knew the good ladyship would sink so they all had life jackets this time. <i>Titanic 2 prominently</i> features <a href=Matt's%20mom.html>Matt's mom</a> laughing at increasingly abstract footage of herself, apparently blissfully unaware of the carnality and agony yet to unfold in the rest of the film.
