	<img src="math.svg"> Trisha Paytas is one of the first characters created by the founders of Horses940. Based on a popular youtube and onlyfans creator with the same name, Trisha Paytas is first introduced into the Horses940 universe in the smash hit video zoey101 SEASON 5 PREMIERE.<br><br>	The character's name is based on two qualities she espouses, that is, "Trisha" (short for nutrition), and Penis. Trisha's enemy is the Horses940 character Barack Obama, according to the Washington Post.<br><br>	Widely considered Horses940's first collab this character is contained within <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a>'s body, but controlled by the energy of Trisha Paytas - a feat achieved by supernatural means. When on set, Trisha Paytas designed her character's costume in the hopes of making <a href=Matt.html>Matt</a>'s physical form represent her own inner emotional one. While Matt has been said to "be built like a rack of ribs," the transformation was considered a success, and Trisha Paytas the character was born.
