	<h2>Accolades</h2><p>Matt of Horses940 is known and lauded within the film industry for being a wildly succesful spelling bee champion. Often brought in to spell check film titles for majer motion studios, Matt holds 53 titles in national spelling bees held across the United States. 50 of these were obtained during 2013, an odd coincidence which Matt tweeted about years later, saying "Yeah, in 2013 I spelled my way to the Wite [sic] House. Feelin' so famoussss." It was later revealed that Matt has never visited the White House, although his statement may have been some form of Gen-Z manifestation that has yet to come about.<br><br>	In 2018, a year before Horses940 coalesced, Matt entered the Mr. Kentucky pageant. It is widely believed that he did this to impress Donathan Hurley, a Kentuckian who shot to fame after his appearance on Survivor, Season 36, Ghost Island, a season in which contestants battled ghosts and demons. The season had historically low ratings as viewers could not see the ghosts, and assumed the events were faked. Matt, a known psychic, used his psychotic powers to actually see the ghosts and communicate through them to Donathan. When Donathan did not send any messages back, Matt hitchhiked to Kentucky to find him and ended up in the nationally acclaimed pageant. Matt was crowned the winner of the Mr. Kentucky pageant mere seconds after stepping onto stage, but he promptly surrendered the award to Donathan, and did not take public credit for his win.</p><br><br><h2>Education</h2><p>N/A</p><br><br><h2>Health</h2><p>Matt has never been to a doctor, not even during his birth. He walks with a limp due to gout and lost all of his teeth in a claw machine accident.</p>
