	<h1>Horses University</h2>
	<p>
	Horses University is an online not-for-education profit institution, based out of Yo Mama's Ass. The University excels in hobby-horse races, handily beating its main rivel in that arena, The University of Lorton.<br><br>	Originally founded in 1947 by runaway Nazi scientist Dr. Heinz Poopfentrousers, Horses University was at big risk of closing after its chemistry program was revealed to be nothing more than a charade. Many students complained that they were woefully unprepared for internships at such world-famous and prestigious chemistry labs as United Synthesis Acetate Inc., and Poopfentrousers Chemical Company. It turned out after an internal investigation that the chemistry program was more like alchemy and witchcraft than anything else, and that the pseudoscientific quest to turn lead into gold fizzled out several hundred years before the University's founding. This has been blamed on alchemists "giving up" and curing cholera instead.<br><br>	Witchcraft, however, continues to be a successful program at Horses University, and many warlock students find gainful employment selling their spells on Etsy. The program had the largest enrollment until June 23, 2013 when it was eclipsed by the Crocheting major / Selling Crocheted Goods on Etsy minor.<br><br>
